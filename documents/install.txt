This installation of ARPACK builds upon cmake and could for
example be used as follows:

1. Locate the folder where ARPACK is to be installed.

cd $HOME/arpack/build

2. Execute cmake, assuming that $HOME/arpack is the arpack
source folder and that MPI is to be used.

cmake $HOME/arpack -DMPI=ON

3. Make the package

make

The following compilation additionally are avaible,

-DMPI=ON            "Enable parallel support (default=OFF)"
-DSYSTEM_BLAS=ON    "Use system BLAS (default=ON)"
-DSYSTEM_LAPACK=ON  "Use system LAPACK (default=ON)"
-DEXAMPLES=ON       "Compile ARPACK examples (default=OFF)"

To explicitly link BLAS and LAPACK the flags could be used:
-DBLAS_LIBRARIES:FILEPATH=/usr/lib/libblas.so
-DLAPACK_LIBRARIES:FILEPATH=/usr/lib/liblapack.so
